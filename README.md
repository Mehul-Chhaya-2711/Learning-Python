Topic: Just Basics: Remember it is a formal and not Natural language. It means exactly what the words mean; no figures of speech involved.

•	A chevron is an inverted V-shaped pattern. The word is usually used in reference to a kind of fret in architecture, or to a badge or insignia used in military or police uniforms to indicate rank or length of service, or in heraldry and the designs of flags.
•	The chevron, >>>, is the prompt the interpreter uses to indicate that it is ready. If you type 1 + 1, the interpreter replies 2.
•	Types of Errors:
o	Syntax Errors: Occurs when the code has not been written in specified formats
o	Run Time Errors: Occurs when something bad happens during code run such as DIVIDE BY ZERO error
o	Semantic Errors: There won’t be an error returned in the end. Output will be present. But won’t be true to the actual purpose of the code. Backward debugging i.e. output to code is the way to solve it.
•	Debugging: “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”
